## Testing:
- [x] Update response 

### Integration testing
- [ ] [Schedule appointment](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=TestingFacility)
- [ ] All msg & type enum variants should be tested during integration
- [ ] Test suite for stress and performance


## Future directions:
### Ease of use:
- [ ] `Option`-based field access through request/response enums?
- [ ] Error type for Parse should integrate with `nom::Err` more cleanly

### Performance:
TBD. Plenty to be done.
